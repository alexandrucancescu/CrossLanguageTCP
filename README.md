# CrossLanguageTCP
A cross language implementation of TCP sockets in Java and C#. The example shows how to send Strings and integers. 

<strong>How to user</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Start the Java server</li>
  <li>Start the C# client</li>
  <li>Write message in console to send to the server</li>
</ol>

This is just a vary basic implementation of sockets with C# and Java that I made to help others.
